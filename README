Fortran 90 code to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 
1D potential solving the Schroedinger equation using a Numerov 
approximation. 

Programs

Energies and wave functions for bound states

tise_1D_morse   : 1D Morse potential
tise_1D_pteller : 1D Poeschl-Teller potential
tise_1D_wsaxon  : 1D Woods-Saxon potential


Energies and wave functions for potential in a rigid wall box

tise_1D_morse_box   : 1D Morse potential
tise_1D_pteller_box : 1D Poeschl-Teller potential
tise_1D_wsaxon_box  : 1D Woods-Saxon potential


Makes use of minpack and intlib libraries (see LICENSES file).
